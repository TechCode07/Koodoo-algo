###Problem Statement

const accountBalanceHistory = [
    {
        monthNumber: 0, // current month
        account: {
            balance: { amount: 0 },
        },
    },
    {
        monthNumber: 1, // last month
        account: {
            balance: { amount: 100 },
        },
    },
    {
        monthNumber: 2, // two months ago
        account: {
            balance: { amount: 200 },
        },
    }
]

    Your goal is to write a function that determines from someone's ${accountBalanceHistory} ðŸ§¾ (see the array above for an example)
    whether this array is of type A (variable) or type B (fixed).
  
    Type ðŸ…° denotes a balance history where the balance amount decreases by varying amounts each month.
  
    Type ðŸ…± is one where the balance amount changes by the same amount each month.
    
    
   ##Unit test cases are not written but all the possible test cases are covered in the function.
